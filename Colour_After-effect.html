<h1>Colour After-effect</h1>
<br>
<br>
This page lets you demonstrate the "colour after-effect" on
yourself.&nbsp; More than just being an interesting experiment, the
colour after-effect enables you to deduce the that you have 3 cone
types, and to work out the colours they are most sensitive to.<br>
<br>
The procedure is as follows.<br>
1.&nbsp;&nbsp; Sit a comfortable distance from the screen.<br>
2.&nbsp;&nbsp; Stare at the cross in the middle of the coloured squares
("fixate" on the cross).&nbsp; It is important not to let your gaze
drift because you want to expose a fixed group of your cones to each
colour to allow their photo-pigment to bleach.<br>
3.&nbsp;&nbsp;  Count slowly to 30.<br>
4. &nbsp; Switch your fixation point to the cross on the right-hand
side of the screen and record the colours that you see.&nbsp; Try hard
blinking to intensify the colours.<br>
<br>
There are 3 sets of squares to test.&nbsp; Just follow the link on each
page after you have recorded the colours you saw.<br>
